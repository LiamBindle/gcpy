Tutorials
---------

The following pages are longer-form tutorials that illustrate analyses, tools,
and techniques using gcpy and Python in general. Each tutorial is written as
a `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ which you can download from `the
official gcpy repository <http://github.com/gcst/gcpy/tree/master/tutorials>`_
and run on your own machine

Basic Topics
